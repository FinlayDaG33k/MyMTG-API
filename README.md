# MyMTG
MyMTG is a framework to allow players to organize their play.  
There is still a whole lot to do, but the idea is that developers can simply hook into the API to use their app.  
players don't need an account for every individual app, but can rather login with one account on every app.  
THe API is a bit limited at the moment, but I expect it to get expanded in the near future.

# MyMTG-API
The API for MyMTG developed by FinlayDaG33k.
Almost bleeding edge!
